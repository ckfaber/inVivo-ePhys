# Configure Matlab
To ensure all code functions seamlessly across different devices and operating systems, please do the following:

## 1) Ensure you are running MATLAB R2022a or newer
Code may work for previous versions, but use at your own peril.

## 2) If you don't already have one, create a MATLAB project folder. From MATLAB command window:

```
cd('C:\Users\<YourUserNameHere>')
mkdir('MATLAB')
```

## 3) Download required functions and SDKS
You will need the Signal Processing Toolkit, and Plexon's Offline Analysis SDK.

### To install the Signal Processing Toolkit, {DO THIS STUFF}
### To install Plexon's SDK, visit https://plexon.com/software-downloads/#software-downloads-SDKs, and click "OmniPlex and MAP Offline (For reading previously recorded data files)", then "OmniPlex and MAP Offline SDK Bundle" to download the zip. 

## 4) Set your MATLAB userpath, and search path.
